# 6.830FinalProject

Notes: 

- only David can set the 1 reviewer limit for the next two weeks (to my knowledge). Atm I think its prolly fine to just make the development branch protectted. Here are the instructions I googled:
    - Navigate to your project's Settings > Repository.
    - Expand Protected branches, and scroll to Protect a branch.
    - Select a Branch or wildcard you'd like to protect.  
    - Select the user levels Allowed to merge and Allowed to push.
    - https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/about-protected-branches

- If you make a pull request, link it to the issue by putting "resolves #<issue number>" in the title of the PR, or one of the other words. Link to documentation: https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue
