# 6.830FinalProject

Notes: 

- only David can set the 1 reviewer limit for the next two weeks (to my knowledge). Atm I think its prolly fine to just make the development branch protectted. Here are the instructions I googled:
    - Navigate to your project's Settings > Repository.
    - Expand Protected branches, and scroll to Protect a branch.
    - Select a Branch or wildcard you'd like to protect.  
    - Select the user levels Allowed to merge and Allowed to push.
